- **Strategy Layer**: Pluggable algorithms for restaurant selection
- **Command Layer**: Command pattern implementation for operation processing

The architecture emphasizes maintainability, extensibility, and adherence to SOLID principles.

## Technical Documentation

### System Architecture

The Food Order Management System is built using a layered architecture with the following components:

1. **Entry Point**: `FoodOrderSystem` class serves as the main entry point and orchestrator
2. **Command Processing**: Commands are processed in timestamp order using a priority queue
3. **Service Layer**: Core business logic for restaurant and order management
4. **Strategy Layer**: Pluggable algorithms for restaurant selection
5. **Model Layer**: Domain entities representing the core business concepts

The system uses several design patterns to ensure flexibility and maintainability.

### Design Patterns

1. **Strategy Pattern**:
   - Interface: `RestaurantSelectionStrategy`
   - Implementations: `LowestPriceStrategy`, `HighestCapacityStrategy`
   - Purpose: Allows dynamic switching between different restaurant selection algorithms

2. **Command Pattern**:
   - Interface: `Command`
   - Implementations: Various command classes for different operations
   - Purpose: Encapsulates operations as objects and executes them in timestamp order

3. **Factory Pattern**:
   - Classes: `CommandFactory`, `StrategyFactory`
   - Purpose: Creates command and strategy objects based on input parameters

### Class Structure

#### Model Classes

1. **Restaurant**:
   - Represents a restaurant with menu, capacity, and order tracking
   - Key methods: `addOrder()`, `dispatchOrder()`, `updateItemPrice()`

2. **MenuItem**:
   - Represents an item in a restaurant's menu
   - Properties: itemId, price

3. **Order**:
   - Represents a customer order
   - Properties: orderId, items, restaurantId, totalAmount, dispatched status

#### Service Classes

1. **RestaurantService**:
   - Manages restaurant operations
   - Key methods: `onboardRestaurant()`, `updateItemPrice()`, `listItems()`

2. **OrderService**:
   - Manages order operations
   - Key methods: `placeOrder()`, `dispatchOrder()`, `getDispatchedOrders()`
   - Uses strategy pattern for restaurant selection

#### Strategy Classes

1. **RestaurantSelectionStrategy** (interface):
   - Defines the contract for restaurant selection algorithms

2. **LowestPriceStrategy**:
   - Selects restaurants based on lowest total price for the order

3. **HighestCapacityStrategy**:
   - Selects restaurants based on highest remaining processing capacity

#### Command Classes

1. **Command** (interface):
   - Defines the contract for command objects
   - Methods: `execute()`, `getTimestamp()`

2. **Various Command Implementations**:
   - `OnboardRestaurantCommand`

   - Replaced verbose switch statements with concise expressions
   - Used in StrategyFactory for cleaner code

3. **Local Variable Type Inference (var)**:
   - Reduced verbosity while maintaining type safety
   - Applied throughout the codebase for local variables

4. **Enhanced Stream API**:
   - Replaced imperative collection processing with functional approaches
   - Used for filtering, mapping, and collecting operations

5. **Try-with-resources Enhancements**:
   - Improved resource management in I/O operations
   - Applied in the main application class

6. **Collection Factory Methods**:
   - Used for creating immutable collections
   - Applied in the demo class for command list creation

### Build and Deployment

The system uses a simple build process with a shell script (`build.sh`) that:

1. Checks the Java version to ensure JDK 17 compatibility
2. Compiles the source code
3. Provides an interactive menu to run either:
   - The interactive console (`FoodOrderSystem`)
   - The demo with predefined commands (`FoodOrderSystemDemo`)

The build script includes error handling and user feedback to ensure a smooth experience.

### Code Examples

#### Before Migration (Java 8)

```java
// Restaurant.java - dispatchOrder method
public void dispatchOrder(String orderId, List<String> items) {
    if (currentOrders.contains(orderId)) {
        currentOrders.remove(orderId);
        
        // Update items served count
        for (String itemId : items) {
            itemsServed.put(itemId, itemsServed.getOrDefault(itemId, 0) + 1);
        }
    } else {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Order " + orderId + " not found in restaurant " + restaurantId);
    }
}

// OrderService.java - getDispatchedOrders method
public List<Order> getDispatchedOrders() {
    List<Order> dispatchedOrders = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Order order : orders.values()) {
        if (order.isDispatched()) {
            dispatchedOrders.add(order);
        }
    }
    return dispatchedOrders;
}

// StrategyFactory.java - createStrategy method
public static RestaurantSelectionStrategy createStrategy(String strategyName) {
    switch (strategyName.toLowerCase()) {
        case "lowest-price":
            return new LowestPriceStrategy();
        case "highest-capacity":
            return new HighestCapacityStrategy();
        default:
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown strategy: " + strategyName);
    }
}
```

#### After Migration (Java 17)

```java
// Restaurant.java - dispatchOrder method
public void dispatchOrder(String orderId, List<String> items) {
    if (currentOrders.contains(orderId)) {
        currentOrders.remove(orderId);
        
        // Update items served count
        for (var itemId : items) {
            itemsServed.merge(itemId, 1, Integer::sum);
        }
    } else {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Order " + orderId + " not found in restaurant " + restaurantId);
    }
}

// OrderService.java - getDispatchedOrders method
public List<Order> getDispatchedOrders() {
    return orders.values().stream()
            .filter(Order::isDispatched)
            .toList();
}

// StrategyFactory.java - createStrategy method
public static RestaurantSelectionStrategy createStrategy(String strategyName) {
    return switch (strategyName.toLowerCase()) {
        case "lowest-price" -> new LowestPriceStrategy();
        case "highest-capacity" -> new HighestCapacityStrategy();
